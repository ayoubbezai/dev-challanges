## 🧩 Description
A small web service hides a secret behind multiple paths.
Nothing is encrypted.  
Nothing is given directly.
The challenge is not about brute force or complex exploitation — it's about **exploration, observation, and understanding context**. Some information is visible, some is implied, and some only becomes useful when placed in the right location.
Read carefully.  
Think logically.  
Follow the paths.
